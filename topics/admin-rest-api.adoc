= Admin REST API

The Keycloak Admin Console is implemented entirely with a fully functional REST admin API.
You can invoke this REST API from your Java applications by obtaining an access token.

You must have the appropriate permissions set up as described in <<_admin_permissions>> and <<_per_realm_admin_permissions>>    

The documentation for this REST API is auto-generated and is contained in the distribution of keycloak under the docs/rest-api/overview-index.html directory, or directly from the docs page at the keycloak website. 

There are a number of examples that come with the keycloak distribution that show you how to invoke on this REST API. `examples/preconfigured-demo/admin-access-app` shows you how to access this api from java. `examples/cors/angular-product-app` shows you how to invoke on it from Javascript.

Finally there is example in `example/admin-client`, which contains example for Admin client, that can be used to invoke REST endpoints easily as Java methods.
