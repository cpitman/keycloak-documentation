= Social Provider SPI

Keycloak provides an SPI to make it easy to add additional social providers.
This is done by implementing `org.keycloak.social.SocialProvider` in `social/core`        and adding a provider configuration file (`META-INF/services/org.keycloak.social.SocialProvider`). 

A good reference for implementing a Social Provider is the Google provider which you can find in `social/google`        on GitHub or in the source download.
