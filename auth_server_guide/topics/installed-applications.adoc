= Installed Applications

Keycloak provides two special redirect uris for installed applications. 

[[_installed_applications_url]]
== Installed Applications url

http://localhost 

This returns the code to a web server on the client as a query parameter.
Any port number is allowed.
This makes it possible to start a web server for the installed application on any free port number without requiring changes in the `Admin Console`. 

[[_installed_applications_urn]]
== Installed Applications urn

`urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` 

If its not possible to start a web server in the client (or a browser is not available) it is possible to use the special `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` redirect uri.
When this redirect uri is used Keycloak displays a page with the code in the title and in a box on the page.
The application can either detect that the browser title has changed, or the user can copy/paste the code manually to the application.
With this redirect uri it is also possible for a user to use a different device to obtain a code to paste back to the application.
