= Adapters

Keycloak can secure a wide variety of application types.
This section defines which application types are supported and how to configure and install them so that you can use Keycloak to secure your applications. 

These client adapters use an extension of the OpenID Connect protocol (a derivate of OAuth 2.0). This extension provides support for clustering, backchannel logout, and other non-standard adminstrative functions.
The Keycloak project also provides a separate, standalone, generic, SAML client adapter.
But that is describe in a separate document and has a different download. 


== General Adapter Config

Each adapter supported by Keycloak can be configured by a simple JSON text file.
This is what one might look like:

Some of these configuration switches may be adapter specific and some are common across all adapters.
For Java adapters you can use `${...}` enclosure as System property replacement.
For example `${jboss.server.config.dir}`.
Also, you can obtain a template for this config file from the admin console.
Go to the realm and select the application you want a template for.
Go to the `Installation` tab and this will provide you with a template that includes the public key of the realm. 

Here is a description of each item: 



realm::
  Name of the realm representing the users of your distributed applications and services.
  This is _REQUIRED._                    

resource::
  Username of the application.
  Each application has a username that is used when the application connects with the Keycloak server to turn an access code into an access token (part of the OAuth 2.0 protocol). This is _REQUIRED._                    

realm-public-key::
  PEM format of public key.
  You can obtain this from the administration console.
  This is _REQUIRED._                    

auth-server-url::
  The base URL of the Keycloak Server.
  All other Keycloak pages and REST services are derived from this.
  It is usually of the form `https://host:port/auth`                        This is _REQUIRED._                    

ssl-required::
  Ensures that all communication to and from the Keycloak server from the adapter is over HTTPS.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is _external_                        meaning that HTTPS is required by default for external requests.
  Valid values are 'all', 'external' and 'none'. 

use-resource-role-mappings::
  If set to true, the adapter will look inside the token for application level role mappings for the user.
  If false, it will look at the realm level for user role mappings.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is _false_. 

public-client::
  If set to true, the adapter will not send credentials for the client to Keycloak.
  The default value is _false_. 

enable-cors::
  This enables CORS support.
  It will handle CORS preflight requests.
  It will also look into the access token to determine valid origins.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is _false_. 

cors-max-age::
  If CORS is enabled, this sets the value of the `Access-Control-Max-Age`                        header.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  If not set, this header is not returned in CORS responses. 

cors-allowed-methods::
  If CORS is enabled, this sets the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`                        header.
  This should be a comma-separated string.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  If not set, this header is not returned in CORS responses. 

cors-allowed-headers::
  If CORS is enabled, this sets the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`                        header.
  This should be a comma-separated string.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  If not set, this header is not returned in CORS responses. 

bearer-only::
  This tells the adapter to only do bearer token authentication.
  That is, it will not do OAuth 2.0 redirects, but only accept bearer tokens through the `Authorization`                        header.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is _false_. 

enable-basic-auth::
  This tells the adapter to also support basic authentication.
  If this option is enabled, then _secret_ must also be provided.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is _false_. 

expose-token::
  If `true`, an authenticated browser client (via a Javascript HTTP invocation) can obtain the signed access token via the URL `root/k_query_bearer_token`.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is _false_. 

credentials::
  Specify the credentials of the application.
  This is an object notation where the key is the credential type and the value is the value of the credential type.
  Currently only `password`                        is supported.
  This is _REQUIRED_. 

connection-pool-size::
  Adapters will make separate HTTP invocations to the Keycloak Server to turn an access code into an access token.
  This config option defines how many connections to the Keycloak Server should be pooled.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is `20`. 

disable-trust-manager::
  If the Keycloak Server requires HTTPS and this config option is set to `true`                        you do not have to specify a truststore.
  While convenient,  this setting is not recommended as you will not be verifying the host name of the Keycloak Server.
  This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is `false`. 

allow-any-hostname::
  If the Keycloak Server requires HTTPS and this config option is set to `true`                        the Keycloak Server's certificate is validated via the truststore, but host name validation is not done.
  This is not a recommended.
  This seting may be useful in test environments This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is `false`. 

truststore::
  This setting is for Java adapters.
  The value is the file path to a Java keystore file.
  If you prefix the path with `classpath:`, then the truststore will be obtained from the deployment's classpath instead.
  Used for outgoing HTTPS communications to the Keycloak server.
  Client making HTTPS requests need a way to verify the host of the server they are talking to.
  This is what the trustore does.
  The keystore contains one or more trusted host certificates or certificate authorities.
  You can create this truststore by extracting the public certificate of the Keycloak server's SSL keystore.
  This is _OPTIONAL_                        if `ssl-required`                        is `none`                        or `disable-trust-manager`                        is `true`. 

truststore-password::
  Password for the truststore keystore.
  This is _REQUIRED_                        if `truststore`                        is set. 

client-keystore::
  _Not supported yet, but we will support in future versions._                        This setting is for Java adapters.
  This is the file path to a Java keystore file.
  This keystore contains client certificate for two-way SSL when the adapter makes HTTPS requests to the Keycloak server.
  This is _OPTIONAL_. 

client-keystore-password::
  _Not supported yet, but we will support in future versions._                        Password for the client keystore.
  This is _REQUIRED_                        if `client-keystore`                        is set. 

client-key-password::
  _Not supported yet, but we will support in future versions._                        Password for the client's key.
  This is _REQUIRED_                        if `client-keystore`                        is set. 

auth-server-url-for-backend-requests::
  Alternative location of auth-server-url used just for backend requests.
  It must be absolute URI.
  Useful especially in cluster (see <<_relative_uri_optimization,Relative URI Optimization>>) or if you would like to use _https_ for browser requests but stick with _http_ for backend requests etc. 

always-refresh-token::
  If _true_, Keycloak will refresh token in every request.
  More info in <<_refresh_token_each_req,Refresh token in each request>> . 

register-node-at-startup::
  If _true_, then adapter will send registration request to Keycloak.
  It's _false_                        by default and useful just in cluster (See <<_registration_app_nodes,Registration of application nodes to Keycloak>>) 

register-node-period::
  Period for re-registration adapter to Keycloak.
  Useful in cluster.
  See <<_registration_app_nodes,Registration of application nodes to Keycloak>> for details. 

token-store::
  Possible values are _session_ and _cookie_.
  Default is _session_, which means that adapter stores account info in HTTP Session.
  Alternative _cookie_ means storage of info in cookie.
  See <<_stateless_token_store,Stateless token store>> for details. 

principal-attribute::
  OpenID Connection ID Token attribute to populate the UserPrincipal name with.
  If token attribute is null, defaults to `sub`.
  Possible values are `sub`, `preferred_username`, `email`, `name`, `nickname`, `given_name`, `family_name`. 

turn-off-change-session-id-on-login::
  The session id is changed by default on a successful login on some platforms to plug a security attack vector (Tomcat 8, Jetty9, Undertow/Wildfly).  Change this to true if you want to turn this off This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is _false_.
