= Troubleshooting

The best way to troubleshoot some problems is to turn on debugging for saml in both the client adapter and the keycloak server.
To do this turn on debugging int the `org.keycloak.saml` package to `debug` in your log4j or other logging framework.
Turning this on allows you to see the SAML requests and response documents being sent to and from the server.
