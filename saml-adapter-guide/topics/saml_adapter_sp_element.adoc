<SP entityID="sp"
    sslPolicy="ssl"
    nameIDPolicyFormat="format"
    forceAuthentication="true"
    isPassive="false">
...
</SP>
----
entityID::
  This is the identifier for this client.
  The IDP needs this value to determine who the client is that is communicating with it. _REQUIRED._                        

sslPolicy::
  This is the SSL policy the adapter will enforce.
  Valid values are: ALL, EXTERNAL, and NONE.
  For ALL, all requests must come in via HTTPS.
  For EXTERNAL, only non-private IP addresses must come over the wire via HTTPS.
  For NONE, no requests are required to come over via HTTPS.
  This is _OPTIONAL._ and defaults to EXTERNAL. 

nameIDPolicyFormat::
  SAML clients can request a specific NameID Subject format.
  Fill in this value if you want a specific format.
  It must be a standard SAML format identifier, i.e. `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient`                    _OPTIONAL._.
  By default, no special format is requested. 

forceAuthentication::
  SAML clients can request that a user is re-authenticated even if they are already logged in at the IDP.
  Set this to `true` if you want this. _OPTIONAL._.
  Set to `false` by default. 

isPassive::
  SAML clients can request that a user is never asked to authenticate even if they are not logged in at the IDP.
  Set this to `true` if you want this.
  Do not use together with `forceAuthentication` as they are opposite. _OPTIONAL._.
  Set to `false` by default. 

turnOffChangeSessionIdOnLogin::
  The session id is changed by default on a successful login on some platforms to plug a security attack vector (Tomcat 8, Jetty9, Undertow/Wildfly).  Change this to true if you want to turn this off This is _OPTIONAL_.
  The default value is _false_.
