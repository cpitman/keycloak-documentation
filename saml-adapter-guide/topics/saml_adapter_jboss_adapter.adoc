= JBoss/Wildfly Adapter

To be able to secure WAR apps deployed on JBoss EAP 6.x or Wildfly, you must install and configure the Keycloak SAML Adapter Subsystem.
You then provide a keycloak config, `/WEB-INF/keycloak-saml.xml` file in your WAR and change the auth-method to KEYCLOAK-SAML within web.xml.
Both methods are described in this section.
