= JBoss Fuse and Apache Karaf Adapter

Currently Keycloak supports securing your web applications running inside http://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/overview/[JBoss Fuse]        or http://karaf.apache.org/[Apache Karaf] . It leverages <<_jetty8_adapter,Jetty 8 adapter>> as both JBoss Fuse 6.1 and Apache Karaf 3 are bundled with http://eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty 8.1 server] under the covers and Jetty is used for running various kinds of web applications. 

What is supported for Fuse/Karaf is: 

* Security for classic WAR applications deployed on Fuse/Karaf with https://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/ops4j/Pax+Web+Extender+-+War[Pax Web War Extender]. 
* Security for servlets deployed on Fuse/Karaf as OSGI services with https://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/ops4j/Pax+Web+Extender+-+Whiteboard[Pax Web Whiteboard Extender]. 
* Security for http://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel] Jetty endpoints running with http://camel.apache.org/jetty.html[Camel Jetty] component. 
* Security for http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] endpoints running on their own separate http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jetty-configuration.html[Jetty engine]. 
* Security for http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] endpoints running on default engine provided by CXF servlet. 
* Security for SSH and JMX admin access. 
* Security for http://hawt.io/[Hawt.io admin console] .
