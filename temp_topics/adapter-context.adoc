The `KeycloakSecurityContext` interface is available if you need to look at the access token directly.
This context is also useful if you need to get the encoded access token so you can make additional REST invocations.
In servlet environments it is available in secured invocations as an attribute in HttpServletRequest.
Or, it is available in secure and insecure requests in the HttpSession for browser apps.
