= Logout

There are multiple ways you can logout from a web application.
For Java EE servlet containers, you can call HttpServletRequest.logout(). For any other browser application, you can point the browser at any url of your web application that has a security constraing and pass in a query parameter GLO, i.e. `http://myapp?GLO=true`.
This will log you out if you have an SSO session with your browser.
