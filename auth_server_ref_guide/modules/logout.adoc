= Logout

There are multiple ways you can logout from a web application.
For Java EE servlet containers, you can call HttpServletRequest.logout(). For any other browser application, you can point the browser at the url `http://auth-server/auth/realms/{realm-name}/tokens/logout?redirect_uri=encodedRedirectUri`.
This will log you out if you have an SSO session with your browser.
